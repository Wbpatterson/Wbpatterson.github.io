            As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in
            my arms and set out walking once more.<u>I felt deeply
            moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was
            carrying a very fragile treasure.</u> <mark id="mark1">It seemed to me, even,
            that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</mark> In the
            moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed
            eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I
            said to myself:<span class="red">"What I see here is nothing but a
            shell. What is most important is invisible . . .‚Äù</span>
            As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a
            half-smile, I said to myself, again:<span class="red">"What moves me
            so deeply about his little prince who sleeping
            here is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose
            that shines through his whole being like the flame
            of a lamp,even when his is asleep . . ."</span> And I felt
            him to be more fragile still. <u>I felt the need of
            protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that
            might be extinguished bt a little puff of wind . . .</u>
